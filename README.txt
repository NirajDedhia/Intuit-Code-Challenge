- Clone the project folder named 'intuit coding challenge' to your local.
- Code is written in JAVA so kindly install suitable IDE to run Java Program.
- Import the Code to IDE.
- Make sure the cloned project has all the files in it (including csv files).
- After you Run it will ask you to enter the file number of the user :
- Kindly enter a number in between 0 and 99. (This I have done so that user can type less
  and get the required data fast and accurate)
- Now it will display the total calculated amount user could have saved from spending, Detail of the
  savings. That means where and in which categories user could have spent less, At the end it will print 
  whether user is a student or not. 
- Following is the output you will get if you type '85' as the number.
